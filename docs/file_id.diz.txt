Hoxs64 is a Commodore 64 emulator for Microsoft Windows with DirectX9. Hoxs64 will present a working user interface that closely resembles the user interface of the original Commodore 64 computer. The project started in England, Cheshire January 2001 as a no profit part time venture by David Horrocks with the help of Commodore 64 community documentation and research by many other people. This software is a tribute to that once great, now legendary home computer the Commodore 64.
