Installation
============
Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 runtime. Both 64 bit and 32 bit version of 
Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 may be installed on 64 bit Windows.
Copy all files in the Hoxs64 zip folder to the same directory.


How to use Hoxs64
=================
Use File / Auto Load to load a game file. Toggle full screen mode with the
[Alt Enter] key combination. You need to be in windowed mode to access the 
menu.

NVidia G-Sync
=============
For best results, set host CPU usage to "aggressive". Use "Line Sync". Use a 
monitor refresh rate that is substantially higher than 50 Hz. If you have a 
high refresh rate monitor then use the 100Hz frame rate doubler option where
possible to prevent IPS LCD pixel burn.

The CPU "friendly" mode causes the application to over sleep and miss its frame 
time slot. The application will try to catch up with fast frames that may 
exceed the user selected G-Sync frame cap and cause either tearing or 
stutter.


Command Line Options
====================
Parameters including path names can optionally be double quoted. Double 
quotes are required when path names include embedded spaces or double 
quotes.


-autoload <filename> {@<directoryitemnumber> | #<directoryprgnumber> | :<directoryitemname> }
Loads a disk, cartridge or tape file and runs a C64 program.

<filename> 
The host PC file name. Supported files are D64 G64 P64 FDI CRT TAP PRG.

<directoryitemnumber> 
A zero based number that specifies which file in a 1541 
disk to load.

<directoryprgnumber> 
A zero based number filtered on just PRG files that specifies which PRG in a
1541 disk to load.

<directoryitemname> 
The CBM DOS name. A colon must precede the name with no space.

Example
hoxs64 -autoload D:\NoDoubleQuoteNeeded\demo.D64
This will load and run the default file in demo.D64

Example
hoxs64 -autoload "D:\My Demos\demo.D64"
This will load and run the default file in demo.D64

Example
hoxs64 -autoload "D:\My Demos\demo.D64" #3
This will load and run the 4th PRG file in demo.D64

Example
hoxs64 -autoload "D:\My Demos\demo.D64" @3
This will load and run the 4th file in demo.D64

Example
hoxs64 -autoload "D:\My Demos\demo.D64" ":chess"
This will load and run the file called CHESS in demo.D64
Uppercase A-Z will refer to C64 shifted graphical glyphs.

-mountdisk <filename>
Mounts a host PC disk file called <filename> but does not automatically load 
any programs.


-quickload
Memory injects the PRG file. This currently does not simulate the exact 
memory pattern that would be caused by real load from tape or disk.

-reu512k
Enable 1750 RAM Expansion Cartridge (512K).


-fullscreen
Start with a full screen display.


-cia-new
Use new CIA.


-cia-old
Use old CIA.


-alignd64tracks
Align D64 tracks.


-debugcart
Enable the debug cart. A write to IO $D7FF will cause the application to 
return an exit code. The first byte written to $D7FF becomes the exit code. 
The actual time of exit is deferred till the end of the current frame.


-exitscreenshot <filename>
Write a screen shot PNG file just before the application exits. <filename> 
is the name of the file. Existing files are overwritten!

Example
hoxs64 -exitscreenshot D:\Pictures\Test.png


-defaultsettings
Load emulation defaults before applying other options. Drive enabled. New 
CIA. D64 track skew. Track zero sensor. SID resample. Default keyboard 
layout. Pepto colour palette. No Extra SID chips; one SID chip at D400.


-window-hide
Do not show an application Window and do not show message boxes. Runs in the
background.


-nomessagebox
Prevent Windows message boxes.


-nosound
No SID sound will be sent to the sound driver.


-limitcycles <n>
Cause the application to exit after <n> number (a 32 bit number) of clock 
cycles with exit code 1.


-hlt-reset
Reset the CPU upon freezing with HLT such as opcode $02 etc.


-hlt-exit
Main CPU HLT exits with exit code 255.


-runfast
Run at the fastest possible speed. Disables sound.


-configfile <filename>
Loads settings from an INI config file specified by <filename> which can either be a full path or
a path relative to the application folder. Double dot ".." and single dot "." path elements are not 
supported. If the -configfile option is missing it will look for a file hoxs64.ini within the 
application folder. If the hoxs64.ini file is missing it will load settings from the registry. 


Examples
hoxs64 -configfile D:\myconfigs\someconfig.ini
hoxs64 -configfile appconfig.ini
